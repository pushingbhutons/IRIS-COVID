# IRIS-COVID
IRIS Virtual Assitant (IRIS-VA) is the AI brain behind the wizard's curtain at [ZEEMZ: The Versipisces Secret](https://zeemz.xyz). 

*IRIS is taking on COVID19. Wanna help her?*

To do this, we're building IRIS-med, an AI solution that will allow doctors to receive real time data from patients playing an educational, augmented reality blockchain game. [ZEEMZ: Pandemic Patch](https://faucet.zeemz.xyz/pandemicpatch/index.html) is only one tiny piece of a much larger puzzle. We can teach people how to handle disasters in a responsible way, while also teaching them digital asset management. The Pandemic Patch proof-of-concept was created for another hackathon, while the ZEEMZ game has been in development for three years. We were getting a Kickstarter campaign together when COVID-19 hit. Prior to Coronavirus, my wife and I wore many hats and were years into learning the technologies used to create the [Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons](https://www.pushingbhutons.com) 'Verse.

[ZEEMZ: The Versipisces Secret](https://www.zeemz.xyz) is envisioned as a cradle-to-grave educational experience where augmented reality comes from the actions players take being reflected in the game world (and, vice versa). **Imagine a community agroforest planted by gamers for gamers, a place where laser-tag takes on a new meaning, and loot drops come with an educational lesson about the tree you found the reward under.** Eventually, players making real life purchases could become in-game items that are equippable, tradable, and sellable. 

*We have a plan to game reality, have you brought your controller?*

## Background: Moe & Jenn developers of ZEEMZ
To support ourselves while building ZEEMZ, we build websites for small mom & pop businesses. We also cofounded a private animal & climate action charity called [RESQ](https://resq.pir8aye.net). We're travelers trying to make a difference everywhere we go. We don't have any experience with building AI, nor with building scalable AI solutions. A year ago, Moe played with SnipsAIR, but only recently began reading the docs from WitAI when COVID struck. She has put in a lot of research hours into every aspect of the game economy and is still developing the white paper. The business plan side of ZEEMZ includes 1, 3, and 5 year projections. The legal side includes submitting requests to the SEC and FTC regarding our multiple digital assets as at least one could be considered a security

*We gamify life to save the planet. Pandemic Patch is our first attempt to get help from the tech community.*
